Youtube Clone is exactly what the name says, a Youtube Clone web app built with React Js
- I used React js and Material UI for the main part of this project
- The videos displayed are real time videos gotten from a Youtube Api from Rapid API website
- Axios was used for the API calls
- The project follows good folder practices with well structured and ordered folders and files
- I also used best React practices and concepts like useState, useEffects, react-router, props etc. during this project
- This project is fully responsive on basically all devices
